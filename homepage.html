										   SOME WORDS IN EXPLANATION


					If any one should be interested enough to inquire as to the reason for
					my becoming a sky spy, an aërial observer, a deuce, or whatever one
					chooses to call it, I should certainly speak the truth and affirm that
					it was not the result of calm, cool and deliberate thought. I have
					always had a holy horror of airplanes and to this day I cannot say that
					I exactly enjoy riding in them. My sole reason for flying now is that I
					am still in the Air Service and there is not an excuse in the world for
					a young man being an air officer if he does not spend a part of his time
					in that element. Every boy in his own heart wants to be a soldier
					whether his mother raises him that way or not: as a boy and as a man I
					wanted to be an infantryman. Upon being commissioned in Infantry
					following the First Officers’ Training Camp, I was about to have a
					lifetime’s ambition gratified by being placed in charge of a company at
					Camp Lewis, Washington, when along with two hundred other new officers I
					was ordered to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for assignment with the Missouri and
					Kansas troops. I had been enthusiastic over the infantry, I liked it
					fine, and most of all I wanted to train my company and lead them into
					action. Arriving at Fort Sill, we found that the troops had not arrived
					and would not come for at least a month. Meanwhile we stagnated and lost
					our pep. The papers were full of the pressing need of help at the battle
					front and still all around I could see nothing but destructive delay. It
					was the old call of the individual—for though my heart was set upon the
					ideal of training my own men for the supreme test yet I could not stand
					the delay. I was determined to get to the Front and with that as my
					paramount ideal, I would take the first opportunity that would lead to
					its realization.

					The chance came one morning early in September, 1917, when one of my
					friends, Lieut. Armin Herold, caught me going out of the mess hall late
					(as usual) for breakfast and excitedly told me that the Division
					Adjutant had just tacked a little notice on the door at Headquarters, in
					response to an urgent request from General Pershing, that ten officers
					who ranked as First or Second Lieutenants would be detailed at once for
					training as airplane observers, and would be sent to France immediately
					upon completion of their training. Volunteers were requested. That part
					about “training as airplane observers” was Greek to me—I did not know
					that such things existed—but at the word “France” I pricked up my ears
					like a fire horse at the sound of a bell. My decision was formed then
					and there. I was going to be an aërial observer, whatever that was, and
					nothing was going to keep me from taking that chance, my first
					opportunity, to go to France.

					I almost lost my breakfast at the thought of having to ride in an
					airplane, but that promise to send me to France at once was an
					anesthetic to my better judgment, and I right away made my first flight,
					au pied, covering that ten acres of plowed ground over to the Division
					Headquarters in ten flat. I rushed in and made application.

					The Divisional Signal Officer was a Major who felt that aërial
					observation was an extremely technical branch. He did not know a
					terrible lot about it, and told me that he had placed the bulletin on
					the board only a few minutes before and was surprised that I had
					responded so quickly. He asked me a lot of trick questions as to my
					technical training, and now, since I have made a fair record as an
					aërial observer, I don’t mind making the confession that I, along with
					other conspirators desiring early action, made several “for the period
					of the emergency” statements. The Major wanted to know if I knew
					anything about civil engineering. I told him I did, but, as a matter of
					fact, I hardly knew the difference between a compass and a level. He
					asked me if I got sick in an airplane. I flinched a little, but told him
					“No,” the presumption of innocence being in my favor. He then asked me
					if I had ever ridden in one. I laughed so heartily at this joke that he
					was convinced that I had. The truth of the matter was that previous to
					that time if anyone had ever got me in an airplane they would certainly
					have had to hog-tie me and drag me to the ordeal. He then wanted to know
					what experience I had with mechanical engines. I told him that my
					experience was quite varied and that I considered myself an expert on
					mechanical engines, having had a course in mechanical engineering. This
					was all true, yet I do not, to this day, know the principles surrounding
					the operations of an engine, and if anything ever should go wrong, the
					motor would rust from age before I could fix it.

					My application was hasty and unpremeditated and I did not actually
					realize what I had done until I got outside—then, just as after the
					unpremeditated murder, the murderer will turn from the body and cry,
					“What have I done?”—so I turned from that house with exactly the same
					thought, and as I walked back to my barracks I kept repeating to myself,
					“What have I done!” “What have I done!” The big question then was to
					find out the nature of the new job for which I had volunteered. The
					first question I asked of the two hundred officers when I returned to
					the barracks was: “What is an airplane observer?” No one present could
					enlighten me.

					I had volunteered for so many things in this man’s army which had never
					panned out either for me or for any one else, that I was naturally
					apprehensive as to the result. Having in mind such dire consequences
					should the thing turn out, and yet hopeful of a more pleasant outcome, I
					alternately anticipated and naturally brooded a great deal over the
					thing.

					The next morning I learned that the telegram had actually been sent to
					the War Department at Washington and that my name had been first on the
					list. The package of fate was not only sealed, but clearly addressed,
					and I was the consignee.

					In a remarkably short time the orders came from Washington and ten of us
					were loaded in a Government truck and transported to Post Field. Of
					those ten Lieutenants it is interesting to note that seven got to the
					Front, and from those seven one can pick five of America’s greatest sky
					spies. Every one of the seven was decorated or promoted in the field.
					They were Captain Len Hammond, of San Francisco; Captain Phil Henderson,
					of Chehallis, Oregon; Captain Steve Barrows, of Berkeley, California;
					Captain How Douglas, of Covina, California; First Lieut. Armin Herold of
					Redlands, California, and First Lieutenant “Red” Gunderson, of Spokane,
					Washington. These were the first officers detailed in the United States
					to “Aërial Observation.”

					The Observation School at Fort Sill was just being started and was yet
					unorganized, so after a very extensive course covering four weeks of
					about one hour a day, in which we learned practically nothing of real
					help, we were ordered to France for duty.

					After an unusually short stay in the S.O.S., or Zone of the Rear, we get
					to the Zone of Advance at a place named Amanty, where we were stationed
					at an observer’s school, and, after a very incomplete course there, we
					were distributed among French squadrons operating over the Front, in
					order that we might get some actual experience, since the Americans had
					no squadrons yet ready for the Front.

					But a word as to the reason for this book. Here is how it happened. We
					were at this school at Amanty, hoping each day for orders to move us on
					up to the real front. It was in February, 1918, and one day, by a great
					streak of good fortune, Major Schwab, the school adjutant, picked on me
					as I was passing the headquarters. “Hey, what’s your name!” he said, to
					which I replied, with a “wish-to-make-good” salute.

					“Here!” he continued, in a most matter-of-fact way, “you are excused
					from classes this morning. Take the commanding officer’s car, go down to
					Gondrecourt, and pick up three Y.M.C.A. girls who are going to give an
					entertainment out here this afternoon. Report them to me.”

					This was an unexpected pleasure, so, with all pomp and dignity, I seated
					myself in the rear of a huge Cadillac, with “Official” painted all over
					the sides of it. It was my first ride in the select government
					transportation—I had previously drawn trucks. Then we whisked along the
					ten miles to Gondrecourt. The surprise was a happy one, because the
					three girls were peaches, and, an aviator being a scarce article in
					those days (and I wore my leather coat to let them know that I was one),
					I was received most cordially.

					We had just started back to the camp, and I was Hero Number One of
					Heroes All, when they all harped as of one accord, demanding if I would
					not take them up in an airplane. This is a feminine plea which never
					seems to become old, because every girl you see nowadays still asks the
					same question. But I maintained silence on the subject of taking them
					up. So, they talked about aces, seemingly positive that I was one of
					those things—what a wonderful flyer I must be—and a lot of other bunk,
					until I began to feel exalted as if I were of the royalty, for it seemed
					that I was being worshipped.

					I interrupted their wild rambling to ask if they objected to my smoking.
					Of course, being a hero aviator, there was no chance for objection. So,
					as I unbuttoned my leather coat, threw back the left lapel, and pulled
					out a stogie from my pocket, the eyes of one cute little frizzle-haired
					girl fell upon my aviation insignia, which, of course, consisted of only
					one wing. Wild eyed and with marked disdain, she exclaimed sneeringly to
					the others, “Oh, he’s only an observer! A half aviator!”

					Actually I had not claimed otherwise, but, as long as I live, I shall
					never forget the sting of those words, and especially the biting
					insinuation on the word “only.” To their minds I was a branded
					hypocrite. Talk about the poor man standing before the criminal judge
					and being sentenced to the impossible “99 years” in the penitentiary;
					well, take it from me, this was worse, for my foolish pride had been
					embellished to an acute cockishness by this preliminary adoration, but
					my soaring little airplane of selfish egoism took a decided nose-dive—it
					smashed my whole day’s happiness.

					The other girls, and in fact this little frizzle-topped girl, too,
					realized immediately the impropriety of the remark, and tried in the
					most sincere way to temper the sting and alleviate my apparent
					embarrassment. The only hollow remark I could offer, in my futile
					attempt at indifferent repartee, was to the effect that pilots would be
					aces always, and observers, being the lowest card of the deck, must be
					deuces. They laughed—I don’t know why—perhaps to jolly me along. I
					intended to say something else, but they took advantage of the necessity
					of my taking a breath—by laughing—so I dropped the “deuce” gag, but, as
					the conversation went on, the more chagrined I became.

					When we finally got to camp, I turned over the precious cargo to the
					camp adjutant, and then struck out for a long hike by my lonesome to
					walk it off.

					But, like an “ignorant idealist,” heeding the call of the fair sex, I
					went to the entertainment that afternoon, and, as I left the hut with
					several other observers, we met the entertainers who were now walking
					along in company with the commanding officer. Of course, we all saluted,
					the commanding officer sloppily returned it, and the party passed on.
					Then this same little frizzle-top, red-headed girl, as if by
					afterthought, recognized me, turned around, and begrudgingly nodded as
					if meeting a disgraced member of the family. She disdainfully called the
					attention of the commanding officer and the other girls to my humble
					presence by saying, “He is the observer that came out with us in the
					car—you know the ‘deuce,’” and, I might add, she laughed lightly and
					shrugged her shoulders. I’ll tell the world it hurt my pride, and I was
					off with all of womankind for the time being. I had labored under the
					impression that an observer was some big gun in aviation. Believe me,
					she took it out of me.

					In fact, these two incidents with this young lady revealed to me for the
					first time the real insignificance of my position as an aërial observer.
					A thousand times afterwards, when I still wore an observer’s insignia,</p>
